# IIT-B CS Course Inline Load
A Chrome browser extension to load IIT-B CS Course "More Info" links inline.
-- --

Install the extension from here:


Goto any IIT-B CS course page (Eg. [Spring Course List](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/page137))

Clicking the More Info links will load the data within the webpage as opposed to the default (without extension) behavior of redirecting you.

The extension also makes the course page span the entire width of the window.
